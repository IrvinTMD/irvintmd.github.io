Again With much thanks to the Outcomes Producer at GA, the Head of Data at Traveloka, Ainun, was invited to a sharing session at GA in the morning of October 31st.<br>
<br>
I have been looking forward to this session ever since I got to know about them a few weeks before. I love exploring and have gone on several backpacking trips before. Services like Traveloka really takes away lots of hassle when it comes to travelling. In addition, I felt that with my interest in Anomaly Detection and Recommender System, I would be able to contribute significantly to the team.<br>
<br>
As one of Indonesia's unicorns that is still growing rapidly, it is not just a challenge, but also sheer excitement to be able to drive the growth of Traveloka. On top of that..<br>

The culture, and direction of the company, as shared by Ainun, piqued my curiosity further. After this session, I found myself yearning to find out even more about the company, and perhaps, potential opportunities to be a part of their team.<br>
