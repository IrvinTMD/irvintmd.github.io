description: How was the first day like?
---
It was a huge class. There were 24 of us, with 2 teaching assistants and 1 instructor. This is the instructor's third DSI batch, so, +1 for having an experienced instructor!  

<br>
We did lots of setting up and installation:
<ul>
	<li>Anaconda</li>
	<li>Python Packages</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>PostGreSQL</li>
	<li>Text Editors</li>
</ul>

It was quite a headache due to the size of the class. We did manage to get most sorted out though. 
Regardless, we moved on to some Python Basics toward the end of the day. It was a breeze since I 
had some prior experience with Python, through online courses like edX, Datacamp etc.

	Intensive, intensive, intensive!

Throughout the day, that was pretty much the message that was constantly popping up. We were 
continuously warned that the program will be highly fast-paced and intensive. Evenings and 
weekends would be consumed by data. The next 12 weeks will be a data fest. And, we are to be 
prepared for it!
